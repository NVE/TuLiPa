- System for results. Abstract type and generic function to transfer problem results to result type. Methods to update model objects with results from other problems.
- We can use the time-series more efficiently. Now very generic:
--- If data points have constant distance between them, we can make a more efficient getweightedaverage that takes advantage of this
--- Many objects can get data from the same time-series. Instead of the same calculations being done several times, we could store the results in an intermediate storage
--- We could store the index of the previous time-series query, to quicker look up the next value
- Make the offset independent of the scenario, a possibility is to alter the offset to include two elements:
--- Yearly offset: Find the equivalent time in another year
--- TimeDelta offset: Offset the yearly offset with  (now offset only have this element)
- Make structures for ramping restrictions, watercourse with time delay (arrow), hydro reservoir segmented end value, negative lower bound, 
- Extend Prob interface to allow setrhs!(prob, conid, value) instead of setrhsterms!
- Better error messages for including dataelements
- Code can be made more robust by validating more inputs/behaviour
- Clean up reasoning_modelobjects.jl
- Add metadata for more objects
- Startupcost that support other variables like Storage, and also ramping
- Implement RoRRHSTerm. A simplification of the run-of-river hydropower could be to include the inflow (with cutoff at max production) as a parameter rather than modelling it as a variable. Motivation is simplification of the problem or to include the unregulated inflow when we make an AdaptiveHorizon based on the residual load
- Account for hydropower head in production calculation and in algorithm
- Look at default costs of breaching environmental constraints for dataset used in Demo 4 and 5.
